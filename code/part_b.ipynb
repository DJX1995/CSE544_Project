Inference the equality of distributions between the two states (distribution of daily #cases and daily #deaths) for the last three months of 2021 (Oct, Nov, Dec) of your dataset using K-S test and Permutation test. For the K-S test, use both 1-sample and 2-sample tests. For the 1-sample test, try Poisson, Geometric, and Binomial. To obtain parameters of these distributions to check against in 1-sample KS, use MME on the Oct-Dec 2021 data of the first state in your dataset to obtain parameters of the distribution, and then check whether the Oct-Dec 2021 data for the second state in your dataset has the distribution with the obtained MME parameters. For the permutation test, use 1000 random permutations. Use a threshold of 0.05 for both K-S test and Permutation test.\n","\n","Assume random variable X ~ Pois(λ), E[X] = λ and Var(X) = λ.\n","\n","Assume random variable X ~ Geo(p), E[X] = 1/p and Var(X)
